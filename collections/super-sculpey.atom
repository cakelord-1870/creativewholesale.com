<p>Super Sculpey® Firm is the answer to many sculptors’ desire for a clay they can carve, <a href="https://www.sculpey.com/19-tools">tool</a> and detail with none of the blurring and bending found in softer polymer clays. This firm polymer clay is gray in color, making it easy for both sculptors and photographers to see even the tiniest detail and, when necessary, catch it on film. After curing in the oven, Super Sculpey® Firm can be sanded, drilled, carved and painted with water-based acrylic paint.</p>
<h2>
<span>Working With </span>the Strongest Polymer Clay</h2>
<p><span>When you work with Super Sculpey®  Firm, you will notice in an instant how firm it is. In fact, it's the firmest polymer clay we offer, which makes it an excellent choice if you prefer clay that's more solid, both before and after baking. Because it's so firm, it is fantastic for projects where you want to create minuscule and realistic features. If you're experienced and interested in diving into more complex and detailed creations, Super Sculpey® Firm is the right choice for you!</span></p>
