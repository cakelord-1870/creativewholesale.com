With a ceramic-like feel, Super Sculpey Living Doll Clay is available in a semi-translucent beige that, once baked, captures the glow of real skin. It can also be mixed with Premo or Sculpey III to change the color. As with all of our polymer clays, it is easy to condition right out of the package and stays soft until you bake it. Super Sculpey features fine tooling and detailing characteristics, and does not “fill in” after tooling. Because of the fine tooling and detailing characteristics of Super Sculpey, it is frequently the chosen clay for making prototypes from which molds are made from the Super Sculpey sculptures; then reproductions are made using the molds. Additionally, artists are producing finely detailed finished sculptures using Super Sculpey. After curing in the oven, Super Sculpey can be sanded, drilled carved and painted with water-based acrylic paints.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/small\u003e\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 15px; color: #4c4c4c; font-family: Lato, HelveticaNeue, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #fafafa; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;\"\u003e\u003cspan align=\"left\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"\u003e\u003cspan size=\"2\" face=\"Arial\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-family: Arial; font-size: small;\"\u003eSuper Sculpey Living Doll is available in Beige, Light, and Baby Colors\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 15px; color: #4c4c4c; font-family: Lato, HelveticaNeue, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #fafafa; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;\"\u003e \u003c\/p\u003e","products":[{"product_id":"super-sculpey-living-doll-clay-1-lb-beige","title":"Super Sculpey Living Doll Clay, 1 lb Beige ZSLD-1","description":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSuper Sculpey Living Doll Clay, 1 lb Beige  ZSLD-1\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan id=\"dnn_ctr436_ContentPane\" align=\"left\"\u003e\u003cspan id=\"dnn_ctr436_ProductPage_lblItemHtmlHolder\"\u003e\u003csmall\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: small;\" size=\"2\" face=\"Arial\"\u003eSuper Sculpey Living Doll Clay is a very unique polymer clay, loved by artists, dollmakers and animation studios around the world.
